20 years as a project manager, process engineer, and business analyst have positioned Dave well for his role as General Manager of Happy Cog. Daveâ€™s iron-clad business acumen and his uncanny ability to dissect every aspect of Happy Cog's operations using his pedigree in information technology and love of economics, combine to make him the right person to oversee Happy Cog's day-to-day activities.

Prior to joining the Happy Cog family, Dave founded DeVersified Business Solutions with the goal of helping small to medium-sized businesses improve their process and project management using cost effective, web-based applications.

Dave writes and speaks on the topic of business and project management. He lives in southern New Jersey with his wife and daughter, and has an active role in the youth soccer and tennis programs offered in his community. When not working or coaching, he can be found playing his guitar, rather poorly, reading, and listening to music.
